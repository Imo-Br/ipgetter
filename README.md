## IPGetter

Its a lil program, I made in rust, that uses an api to fetch info about an IPV4\

Like the ISP, country, region etc.

To build it make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed\
To build it all you need to is run

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

You should find the binary executable, in your target/release\
Optionally you could also just build it and run it with one simple command

```sh
$ cargo run -- --release
```
